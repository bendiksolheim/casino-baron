# Casino Baron

Casino Baron is a game about managing a casino. Start from the bottom and build
your casino empire from scratch.

## Setting
You have just bought a closed down gas station along E6 between Trondheim and
Oslo. It’s the perfect place to stop for people travelling through Norway, but
for some reason the previous owners never managed to make it work. It’s the
perfect location to stop for people in need of gas, power, food, or just some
fresh air. You have the perfect plan to make this go around and get wealthy
while you’re at it – make people stop for the necessities, and make them stay
for your casino! You start small, with a few slot machines in the back, and
expand as you earn money.

This is the start of your casino empire.
